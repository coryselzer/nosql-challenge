# nosql-challenge

## Project Overview

In this challenge, we are tasked with evaluating restaurant data in the United Kingdom to help journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Project Goals

Update Database: We add a new halal restaurant to the database as well as update other values in the database, including removing all restaurants in Dover and converting numerical values from strings to decimals and integers.

Exploratory Analysis: We use advanced queries (including filters, sorting, limiting) to advise our clients on which restaurants to visit and avoid.  This contains an aggregation pipeline as well to give us an idea as to which areas to avoid, as we matched this query to a Hygiene score of 0.
